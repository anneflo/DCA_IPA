This code contains a Matlab implementation of the IPA (or DCA-IPA) as described in "Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences", by Anne-Florence Bitbol, Robert S. Dwyer, Lucy J. Colwell, and Ned S. Wingreen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 113 (43) 12180-12185 (2016), DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1606762113.

Briefly, this is an iterative pairing algorithm (IPA) based on direct coupling analysis (DCA) that aims to predict interaction partners among paralogs from two protein families, just from their sequences. Here it is applied to our "standard dataset" of 5064 sequences of cognate histidine kinases and response regulators from the P2CS database (http://www.p2cs.org/).

Note that a MI-based variant of the IPA was introduced in "Inferring interaction partners from protein sequences using mutual information", by Anne-Florence Bitbol, DOI: 10.1101/378042.

In order to use the code, please run "DCA_IPA_main" under Matlab.
